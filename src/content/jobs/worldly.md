<a href="https://theworldlyapp.com/" target="_blank">The Worldly App</a> is an app to help travelers find trustworthy travel recommendations. I started the company with two other co-founders with a mission to inspire people to travel. Over 2 years later, we've launched our app in the Google Play Store and Apple Store and are continuing to grow our community and improve the experience for our users.

* I worked with my co-founders to develop a feature list and prioritize the features required for a minimum viable product.
* I designed, developed, and deployed a backend infrastructure built on Docker and AWS. It uses Django as the web framwork and includes an API built with Django Rest Framework, a celery task queue for image processing, devops command line tools, and automated builds and testing with CircleCI.
* I designed, developed, and released an Ionic Application for iOS and Android. It uses Angular as the javascript framework and has automated build and testing with CircleCI.
