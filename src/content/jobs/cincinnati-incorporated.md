-   As the lead software developer for the CI Boston business unit, I worked with our General Manager to plan software projects for 2018, 2019, and 2020. All major projects were executed on schedule.
-   Maintained and managed 100+ cloud-connected 3D printers in the field. Worked with customer support to remotely diagnose network configuration problems, detect hardware malfunctions, and debug software issues.
-   Maintained and managed our cloud software stack which includes 10 Linux servers and 4 MySQL databases. I was responsible for updating the cloud software running on the servers and performing data and schema migrations on the database.
-   Designed, developed, tested, and implemented a battery backup circuit and a python service to gracefully shutdown the printer after abrupt power loss to prevent SD card corruption.
-   Researched, designed, and implemented the electronics and wiring for a built-in touchscreen control panel.
-   Using Vue and Vuetify, I designed and developed a web application allowing users to view and control the printer, manage the printer filesystem, drag-and-drop jobs in a print queue, and update printer configuration. The web application was mobile friendly and was bundled into an Electron application to run on a touchscreen.
-   I created an OctoPrint plugin in python to control the printer’s part removal system. I later added the ability to manage a persistent queue of print jobs, automatically removing each print after it’s finished and starting the next job.
-   Developed a more flexible print configuration management system to allow for merging configuration settings provided by the printer, user, and material.
